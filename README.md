# OpenStreetMap History Splitter
This splitter has been developed to split [full-experimental planet dumps](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm/full) but it's also possible to split regular [planet dumps](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm) with it. It's based on the readers and writers of the [Jochen Topfs](https://github.com/joto) great osmium framework.

This is the tool used to create the [hosted extracts](http://osm.personalwerk.de/history-extracts/).

The splitter currently supports splitting by bounding-boxes, .poly-files known from osmosis and .osm polygon files (.osm files containing only closed ways).
It implementes two different cutting algorithms (hard- and softcut), which of softcut is the default.

## [hardcut-algorithm](https://github.com/MaZderMind/osm-history-splitter/blob/master/hardcut.hpp)
Dumps created using that algorithm have the following characteristics:

* ways are cropped at bbox boundaries
* relations contain only members that exist in the extract
* ways and relations are reference-complete
* relations referring to relations that come later in the file are missing this references
* ways that have only one node inside the bbox are missing from the output
* only versions of an object that are inside the bboxes are in the extract, some versions of an object may be missing (not history-complete)

## [softcut-algorithm](https://github.com/MaZderMind/osm-history-splitter/blob/master/softcut.hpp)
* ways stay complete, all used nodes are included (reference-complete)
* relations contains all members, even such that does not exist in the extract (not reference-complete)
* if one version of an object is inside the bbox, all versions are included in the extract (history-complete)
* dual pass processing required

## Build it
In order to compile the splitter, you'll first need the [osmium framework](https://github.com/MaZderMind/osmium) and most of its prequisites:

*   zlib (for PBF support)  
    http://www.zlib.net/  
    Debian/Ubuntu: zlib1g zlib1g-dev  
*   Expat (for parsing XML files)  
    http://expat.sourceforge.net/  
    Debian/Ubuntu: libexpat1 libexpat1-dev  
*   libxml (for writing XML files)  
    http://xmlsoft.org/  
    Debian/Ubuntu:libxml2 libxml2-dev
*   GEOS (for polygon checks)  
    http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/  
    Debian/Ubuntu: libgeos-3.2.0 (older versions might work) libgeos-dev  
*   Google sparsehash
    http://code.google.com/p/google-sparsehash/
    Debian/Ubuntu: libsparsehash-dev
*   Google protocol buffers (for PBF support)  
    http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ (at least Version 2.3.0 needed)  
    Debian/Ubuntu: libprotobuf6 libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler  
    Also see http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format  
*   OSMPBF (for PBF support)  
    https://github.com/scrosby/OSM-binary  
    You need to build this first.  

Osmium needs to be present on your system. If you *make install*-ed osmium then osm-history-splitter will locate the osmium headers. You'll also want the pbf support as .pbf-files can be written between 7 and 20 times faster then .xml.bz2-files. For this you'll need a [version of OSM-binary](https://github.com/scrosby/OSM-binary) that supports storing history information.

When you have all prequisites in place, just run *make* to build the splitter.

## Run it
After building the splitter you'll have a single binary: *osm-history-splitter*. The binary takes two parameters and a few options. The splitter is called like that:

    ./osm-history-splitter input.osm.pbf output.config

the splitter reads through input.osm.pbf and splitts it into the extracts listet in output.config. Optionally the following switches are supported:
* --hardcut - enable hardcut mode
* --softcut - enable softcut mode (default)
* --debug - enable debug output

The config-file-format is simple and line-based. Empty lines and lines beginning with # are ignored. A config-file might looks like this:

    woerrstadt.osh.pbf    BBOX    8.1010,49.8303,8.1359,49.8567
    gau-odernheim.osh     OSM     clipbounds/aaa_test/go.osm
    germany.osh           POLY    clipbounds/europe/germany.poly

each line consists of three items, separated by spaces:

* the destination path and filename. The file-extension used specifies the generated file format (.osm, .osh, .osm.bz2, .osh.bz2, .osm.pbf, .osh.pbf)
* the type of extract (BBOX or POLY)
* the extract specification
  * for BBOX: boundaries of the bbox, eg. -180,-90,180,90 for the whole world
  * for OSM:  path to an .osm file from which all closed ways are taken as outlines of a MultiPolygon. Relations are not taken into account, so holes are not possible.
  * for POLY: path to the .poly file

The POLY files are in Osmosis' *.poly file format. A huge set of .poly files can be found at [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/clipbounds/) (obey the README!) and some tools to work with .poly files are located in the [OpenStreetMap SVN](http://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/utils/osm-extract/polygons/).

## Big Setups
If you are planning to do a huge number of extracts (something like the [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/) does), the split-all-clipbounds.py may be your friend. It scans through the clipbounds directory looking for .poly files (.osm files possible), automatically generates config-files and runs the splitter. It does obey the nesting-rules (ie europe/germany.osm.pbf is generated from europe.osm.pbf) and also ensures the files are created in the correct order.
